Types of Functions in Python 
@START
Functions in Python can be classified into different types based on how they work and where they come from! Let's break it down!
1️. Built-in Functions (Already There!)
These are pre-defined functions that come with Python. You can use them without writing any extra code!
Examples:
\t print() – Displays output.
\t len() – Finds the length of a string or list.
\t max() – Finds the largest number in a list.
\t print(len("Python"))  
\t print(max(5, 10, 3))  
Output: 
\t 6
\t 10
@END
@START
2️. User-Defined Functions (DIY Functions) 
These are functions created by programmers to perform specific tasks. You define them using def and call them when needed.
Example:
\t def greet(name):
\t     print(f"Hello, {name}! ")
\t     greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice! 
@END
@START
3️. Lambda Functions (Tiny but Powerful!)
These are one-liner functions that don’t need a name! They are mostly used for short, quick calculations.
Example:
\t square = lambda x: x * x
\t print(square(4))  
Output: 
\t 16
(Shortcut Alert! Instead of writing a full function, just use lambda!)

@START
Look at an example which includes all types of funtions in one code: 
\t # Built-in Function Example
\t fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
\t print("Total fruits:", len(fruits))  # len() is a built-in function
# User-Defined Function Example
\t def greet(name):
\t     """Returns a greeting message"""
\t     return f"Hello, {name}! "
\t user_name = input("Enter your name: ")  # Built-in input() function
\t print(greet(user_name))
\t # Lambda Function Example
\t square = lambda x: x * x  # Lambda function to find square
\t num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Taking input for lambda function
\t print(f"Square of {num} is:", square(num))
\t # Another Lambda Example (Adding Two Numbers)
\t add = lambda a, b: a + b
\t print(f"Sum of 3 and 5 is:", add(3, 5))
Output:
\t Total fruits: 3
\t Enter your name: Aariona
\t Hello, Aariona! 
\t Enter a number: 4
\t Square of 4 is: 16
\t Sum of 3 and 5 is: 8
@END
