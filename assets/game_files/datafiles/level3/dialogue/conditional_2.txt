@START
Conditional statements are like life decisions—"If this happens, do that; otherwise, do something else."
@END
@START
if Statement
"If it's raining, take an umbrella!"—Simple logic, right? Python works the same way.
weather = "rainy"
\t if weather == "rainy":
\t     print("Take an umbrella! ")
Output:
\t Take an umbrella!
@END
@START
if-else Statement
"If the coffee is hot, drink it. Otherwise, wait."
\t coffee_temp = 90
\t if coffee_temp > 80:
\t     print("Drink carefully! ")
\t else:
\t     print("Wait a bit. ")
Output:
\t Drink carefully!
@END
@START
elif (else if) Statement
Sometimes, there are multiple choices.
"If you get an A, celebrate! If you get a B, feel good. Otherwise, try harder next time."
grade = "B"
\t if grade == "A":
\t     print("Yay! You nailed it! ")
\t elif grade == "B":
\t     print("Good job!")
\t else:
\t     print("Keep going!")
Output:
\t Good job!
@END
