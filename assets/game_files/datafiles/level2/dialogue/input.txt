In Python, the `input()` function is used to get data from a user. It allows the program to pause and wait for user input, storing the entered value as a string.
Key Points:
- Functionality: `input()` takes user input and returns it as a string.
- Prompting: A message inside `input()` can guide the user on what to enter.
- String Return Type:** Input is always stored as a string.

Example:
\t name = input("What is your name? ")
\t print("Hello, ", name)  #Example input: Aariona
Output:
\t Hello, Aariona
@END

Important Considerations:
- Type Conversion: Since input is always a string, use `int()` OR `float()` if numerical input is needed.
\t age = int(input("Enter your age: ")) #Example input: 18
\t print("Your age is: ", age)
Output: 
\t Your age: 18
- Error Handling: Always validate user input to ensure it matches the expected format.
