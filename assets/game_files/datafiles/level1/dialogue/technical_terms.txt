Let me Explain You Some Technical Terms
This will help you to Understand the Python Language Better

Declare:
To declare something means to specify or introduce an entity,
such as a variable, without necessarily assigning it a value.
Variables are declared simply by assigning a value to them.
There is no need to specify the type explicitly because Python is dynamically typed.

Define:
To define something involves creating it with specific functionality,
such as defining a function, class, or variable.
Variables are defined when you assign a value to them.
Functions are defined using the def keyword.

Call:
Calling refers to executing a function or method that has been defined earlier.
You call a function by using its name followed by parentheses ().
If the function takes arguments, you include them inside the parentheses.

Indentation:
Indentation is the space (or tab)
at the beginning of a line of code that determines the structure and grouping of code.
Indentation is mandatory and replaces braces {} 
found in Python and in other languages like C++ or Java.
It defines blocks of code, such as loops, functions, or conditionals

@START
Condition:
A condition is a statement that evaluates to True or False 
and determines whether specific blocks of code will execute..
