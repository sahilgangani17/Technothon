Basic Syntax of Python:
This includes print() function and comments (single and multiline comments).
Every programmer first code is to display "Hello World" into the print() function.
- print("Hello World") #comment

Print Function:
In Python, “print” refers to an in-built (will be covered in other levels)function print(), Which is used to display data or output(standard) on the screen , in which the provided information is automatically converted to a string before being printed.

Points to remember about Print() Function:
-	print("My name is Chen") , this will print “My name is chen” to the console.
-	Python allows to print multiple values in a single line by separating them with comma’s( , ) within print() function, which will automatically add spaces in between.
-	Data type passed to print() can be converted to a string before printing.

For example:
Name = “Hoodle_bee” # datatype: string, variable 
Print(“Hellooww , my name is ”,name) 
Output : Hellooww , my name is Hoodle_bee
@END

Comments:
In Python, a comment is a piece of text added within your code that explains the logic or purpose of a specific line or section of code. Comments are completely ignored by the Python interpreter when running the program. And hence it does not get printed on the Output Screen.

Python interpreter ignores them just as you ignore your preparations for exam whole year.

Syntax: 
A single line comment starts with a '#' (hash) symbol followed by the comment text.
	Example:  #This is MEEE

Multi-line Comments:
 While not a dedicated syntax, you can use triple double quotes or triple single quotes(""" or ''') to create multi-line comments by not assigning them to a variable.
	Example:
    This shows Double quotation
         “”” This is MEee
		NOT YOUUUU
		“””
    This shows Single quotation
        '''this 
        is multiline
        comment 
        '''
