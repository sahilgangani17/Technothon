While Loops in Python 
@sSTART
A while loop is like waiting for something to happen—you keep doing a task until a condition is met.
Real-Life Example
Think about waiting for your phone to fully charge.
-If your battery is less than 100%, you keep charging.
-Once it reaches 100%, you stop charging and unplug.
This is exactly how a while loop works in Python!

Basic While Loop
Let’s say we want to count from 0 to 4:
\t i = 0
\t while i < 5:  
\t     print(i)
\t     i+= 1  
Output:
\t 0  
\t 1  
\t 2  
\t 3  
\t 4  
@END 
@START
Here,
-The loop starts with i = 0.
-It checks if i < 5. If true, it runs the code inside.
-After printing i, it adds 1 (i += 1).
-The loop stops when i = 5 because the condition i < 5 is now false.
@END

The Danger of Infinite Loops
Be careful! If you forget to update i, the loop never stops!

\t i = 0
\t while i < 5:
\t     print(i)  # Oops! Forgot to increment i!
This keeps printing 0 forever—Python won’t stop unless you forcefully exit. 
@END
