For Loop in Python 
@START
A for loop in Python is like playing a playlist—it goes through each song (or item) one by one and performs an action. 
@END

Basic For Loop
Imagine you have a list of your favourite snacks, and you want to print each one.
\t snacks = ["Chips", "Chocolate", "Cookies", "IceCreams"]
\t for snack in snacks:
\t     print(snack)
Output:
\t Chips
\t Chocolate
\t Cookies
\t IceCreams
@END
@START
The loop picks one item at a time from the list and prints it.
When there are no more items left, the loop stops automatically.
Using range() in For Loop
What if you want to repeat something a fixed number of times? That’s where range() helps!
Example (Counting Numbers):
\t for i in range(5):  
\t     print(i)
Output:
\t 0  
\t 1  
\t 2  
\t 3  
\t 4  
range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4 (5 is not included).
@END
@START
Example (Custom Start & Step Size):
Python
\t for i in range(1, 10, 2):  # Start at 1, stop before 10, step by 2
\t     print(i)
Output:
\t 1  
\t 3  
\t 5  
\t 7  
\t 9  
The loop starts from 1, jumps by 2, and stops before 10.
@END
