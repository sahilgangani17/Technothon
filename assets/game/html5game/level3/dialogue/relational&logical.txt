@START
Think of relational expressions as ways to compare things. They help answer questions like "Is this bigger?" or "Are these the same?" by returning True or False.
Common ones:
== (equal to) → Checks if two values are the same.
!= (not equal to) → Checks if two values are different.
<, >, <=, >= → Compare values (less than, greater than, etc.).

Example:
\t age = 18
\t print(age >= 18)
Output:
\t True

Logical Expressions
Logical expressions help combine multiple conditions. They act like filters in decision-making.
and → All conditions must be true.
or → At least one condition must be true.
not → Reverses the condition (True becomes False, and vice versa).
Example:
\t age = 20
\t has_ID = True
\t print(age >= 18 and has_ID)  
Output:
True
