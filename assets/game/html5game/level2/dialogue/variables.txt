@START
A variable in Python is a named storage for data values, acting like a kitchen cabinet that holds ingredients. Python creates a variable as soon as a value is assigned to it, without requiring a declaration step.

@START
To create a variable, assign a value using `=`:
\t age = 18  
\t name = "Aariona"  
\t is_student = True  
\t print("Integer: ", age)
\t print("String: ", name)
\t print("Boolean: ", is_student)
Output:
\t Integer:  18
\t String:  Aariona
\t Boolean:  True
@END

Python automatically determines the data type based on the assigned value.
Important Points:
- Variables are case-sensitive (`Age` and `age` are different).
- Names can include letters, numbers, and underscores ( _ ) but cannot start with a number.
- Use descriptive names like `user_name` for better readability.
- Avoid using RESERVED KEYWORDS like `if`, `for`, or `while` as variable names.
Using clear and meaningful variable names improves code readability and organization.
