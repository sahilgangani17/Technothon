What is a List?
A list is a collection of items stored in square brackets []. These items can be numbers, strings, or even other lists!
Lists are:
Ordered – Items stay in the same order.
Mutable – You can change them after creation.
Allow duplicates – Can store the same value multiple times.

How to Create a List?
\rt # Empty list
\t my_list = []
\t # List with numbers
\t numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
\t # List with mixed types
\t mixed = ["apple", 10, 3.5, True]
\t print(numbers)
\t print(mixed)
Output:
\t [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
\t ['apple', 10, 3.5, True]
Yes! Lists can hold anything—numbers, words, even Booleans!

Accessing List Items
You can grab list items using their index (starting from 0).
\t fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grapes"]
\t print(fruits[0])  
\t print(fruits[-1]) 
Output:
\t apple
\t grapes
Remember: Python starts counting from 0!

When to Use Lists?
1. When you need to store multiple values
2. When you want ordered and changeable data
3. When you need easy access & modification
Lists are one of Python’s most powerful tools—Master them and make coding life easier!
